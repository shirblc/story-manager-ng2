## Version

Version 1 (in progress).

Built using the [angular-gulp](https://github.com/shirblc/angular-gulp) repo.

Originally created as an AngularJS app (see [story-manager-ng1](https://github.com/shirblc/story-manager-ng1) and [story-manager-server-ng1](https://github.com/shirblc/story-manager-server-ng1)). Since AngularJS has now reached it's EOL, I've migrated the project to Angular (currently at version 13).

## Desciption

A story manager app for writers to keep track of their current stories and plotlines. It's currently possible to set a story's basic details and the basic details for each chapter within it. You can create as many stories as you like.

The app utilises Angular for its build and the build tool Gulp for automated tasks.

## Requirements

- Node.js

## Installation and Usage

### Developers

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. cd into the project directory.
3. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
4. Run ```npm run compile:dev``` to compile for the files for local development.
5. Run ```npm run serve``` to start the local server.
6. Open localhost:3000.

**For your convenience,** this project utilises Gulp's 'watch' functionality. In order to activate it  while developing, run ```gulp watch```. For more information about Gulp watch, check the [Gulp documentation](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/watching-files/).

## Contents

### Components

**Located in:** [src/app/components](./src/app/components)

The app contains a Story Manager module (in main.ts), which contains two controllers for two templates:

1. **LibraryManager** (Previously `libraryMgr` + `libraryCtrl`) - Displays the name and synopsis of each added story. Allows users to add and deletec stories.
2. **StoryManager** (Previously `storyMgr` + `storyCtrl`) - Displays the name and synopsis of each chapter within the currently open story. Allows users to edit a story's details, as well sa adding, deleting and editing chapters' details.
3. **storyEdit** - Where the user can edit the story's details.
4. **ErrorPage** - An error page.
5. **Settings** (previously `settings` + `settingsCtrl`) - Allows the users to change several of the app's settings. Still in development.
6. **AddPopup** - The popup for adding chapter/story.
7. **ConfirmPopup** - The popup for confirming before deleting an item.

### Services

**Located in:** [src/app/services](./src/app/services)

1. **librarian** - A service provided in the app root. It's responsible for getting a story's or a library's data and posting changes to the JSON file containing the library information (data/stories.JSON).

### Production Scripts

The project contains two production-ready scripts:

1. **server.js** - Contains a basic Express server with compression, in order to serve files in a production environment.
2. **env-config.js** - Contains a script to find and replace environment variables (in src/environments) with configured environment variables from the hosting environment. This script is an optional adjustment - feel free to delete it if you don't need it.

## Dependencies

### Gulp

The site uses several tools to maximise compatibility:

1. **Gulp** - Gulp enables running tasks automatically. You can read more on the [Gulp website](https://gulpjs.com). Gulp is a Node.js tool, so it requires installing Node.
2. **Gulp-Postcss** with **Autoprefixer** Plugin - A Gulp plugin which adds the necessary browser prefixes to the CSS file. For more info check the [Gulp-postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-postcss) page and the [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) page on NPM.
3. **Rollup** (with @rollup/stream) - A module bundler for JS. Rollup bundles up the main module (AppModule) and converts it from TypeScript to ES6. For more info, check the [Rollup repo](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and Gulp's [Rollup + Gulp recipe](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/rollup-with-rollup-stream.md).

5. **Gulp-Uglify** - A Gulp plugin which minimises the single ES5 file (Babel's output). For more info check the [Gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify) page on NPM.
6. **Gulp-Sourcemaps** - A Gulp plugin utilizing the source maps tool. For more info check the [Gulp-sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) page on NPM.
7. **Gulp-Rename** - A gulp plugin used to rename files. Used to rename the main module JS and to change the directory name of all HTML files. For more info check the [Gulp-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename) page on NPM.
8. **Gulp-replace** - A string replace plugin for Gulp. Used to change the templateUrls in the final JS file. For more info, check the [Gulp-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-replace) page on NPM.

## Testing

### Writing Tests

Tests are written in TypeScript and each component's tests are located in the same directory as the component. Test files' names follow this format: `<component_name>.spec.ts`. This format is the way tests are picked up by the main testing file, and so it's important to keep to it.

End-to-end tests are also written in TypeScript. All end-to-end tests are located in [e2e/src](./e2e/src), and are named in a similar manner to regular specs files: `<something_to_test>.spec.ts`. The Cypress config is in the root (in `cypress.json`), but the plugins and support files are in the [e2e](./e2e) folder as well.

### Running Tests

Running tests is done through the dedicated Gulp task. All you need to do is run `gulp test` in the terminal; this will start Karma and trigger Rollup's compilation of tests and project files.

Running end-to-end tests is done through an npm script. Running `npm run e2e` in the terminal will bundle up assets for testing, fire up the development server and run Cypress.

## Hosting

If you want to clone and host your own version, you can do so by using the following guide (the following commands are for Heroku, but they can be adjusted depending on your host):

1. Create a Heroku account (skip this step if you already have an account).
2. Install the Heroku command line interface.
3. In your Terminal, enter `heroku login`. This triggers logging in via the CLI.
4. Enter `heroku create <APP_NAME>` (with your own app name). If successful, Heroku returns the live version's URL (will be referred to as <LIVE_URL>) and the Git repo link (will be referred to as <GIT_URL>).
5. Add your environment variables (if there are any).
6. Make sure you're in the top directory (FSND-capstone). In your terminal, enter `git remote add heroku-client <GIT_URL>`.
7. Enter `git push heroku-client master`. This triggers the app build. If successful, you'll get a 'Verifying deploy... done.' message.
8. All done! Now you can visit your <GIT_URL> to see the live app.
